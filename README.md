[Hospital Management System]

This is a hospital management user interface for managing, monitoring and controlling the system in a Hospital. This application is developed using Node.js API (backend), Bootstrap(Frontend) && MongoDb(Database), which mainly focuses on basic operations in a hospital like adding new patient information, and updating new information, assigning the doctor for patient. It features a familiar and well thought-out, an attractive online user interface, combined with strong searching Insertion, data visualisation reports and reporting capabilities.

**Objectives Of The System**

Reduce the average time taken to register a patient by automating the current manual patient registration system

Eliminate current manual template filled by the doctors to assist in the diagnosis processiby replacing it with a computerized format

Provide doctors with a streamlined view of medical reports in a digital format by linking the laboratory with the doctors’ computers

Reduce the time spent by a patient at the pharmacy by linking the doctors’ computer with the pharmacy there by eliminating half of the usual process in dispensing medication

Allow for statistical reports on facts such as number of new patients diagnosed, number of fatalities for given period within a short time frame.

Provide an alert facility to remind doctors of patients who are visiting the doctor on a follow up of the previous visit

Create a system with a simple interface that needs limited keyboard input from users
