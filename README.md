[Hospital Management System]

This is a hospital management user interface for managing, monitoring and controlling the system in a Hospital. This application is developed using Node.js API (backend), Bootstrap(Frontend) && MongoDb(Database), which mainly focuses on basic operations in a hospital like adding new patient information, and updating new information, assigning the doctor for patient. It features a familiar and well thought-out, an attractive online user interface, combined with strong searching Insertion, data visualisation reports and reporting capabilities.
